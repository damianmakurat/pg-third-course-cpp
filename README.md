# pg-third-course-cpp
The project of a console C++ simulator "Virtual world" prepared for passing a third course at university.

The game generates a map on which organisms that are either animals or plants are distributed.
The organisms may have special functions or functions different from the default ones. They can attack or reproduce.
The simulator is based on randomness, and successive rounds are called manually.
